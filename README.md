EzApp Re-signer
===============

An OS X app that simplifies the process of re-signing an iOS app down to a few clicks of the mouse. The user is able to drag any ipa into the app window or load it from a menu option. From there, they just have to specify an output directory as to where the final ipa should go and click respond.

This app is currently in beta mode. It can resign an app but does not allow for any extra features such as resigning with a new mobile provisioning profile or specifying entitlements.

Below is a list of a few issues that are in the works:
  * adding an "Advanced" mode that contains the following features
    * adding an option to replace mobile provisioning profile
    * adding the ability to "rewrite" the bundle header
    * add ability to specify an entitlement
  * adding help
  * adding preferences
