EzAppResigner
=============

A OS X app that simplifies the process of re-signing an iOS app down to a few clicks of the mouse.

This app is currently in beta mode. It currently can resign an app but does not allow for any extra features such as resigning with a new mobile provisioning profile.

Below is a list of a few issues that are in the works.

  * adding an option to replace mobile provisioning profile
  * adding the ability to "rewrite" the bundle header
  * add ability to specify an entitlement
  * allowing a user to load IPA files via the menu instead of dragging them into the app
  * adding an icon
