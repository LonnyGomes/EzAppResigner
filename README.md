EzAppResigner
=============

A OS X app that simplifies the process of re-signing an iOS app down to a few clicks of the mouse.

This app is currently in beta mode. 

There are a few tasks that need to be complete before it's usable including:

  * adding an option to replace mobile provisioning profile
  * adding the ability to "rewrite" the bundle header
  * add ability to specify an entitlement
